												<h3>Individual Reflections</h3>
											</header>
												<p>
													<font size="+1">Rico:</font> This project opened up my eyes to the community. We were able to help by using our CTE skills and it gave
													me a really good feeling inside. I took charge of coding a website and while doing so taught myself how to write in HTML. Personally, I thought it was fun. A problem my group had was communication.
													<br> <br>
													<font size="+1">Jonathan:</font> What I learned throughout this project is how to perform certain TIG welds in different and difficult angles. Even though almost all of the community providers we tried to contact ended up not replying, I learned how to talk to them through the forms professional business email. Not only that but I was in charge of writing orders for the metal we ordered and learned how to order them correctly. Our project could have been improved through better communication with each other.
													<br> <br>
													<font size="+1">John:</font> Picking up on TIG welding was the most difficult part in the beginning of the project, as I had to learn the process to actually weld the ski racks together. Personally I found that grinding almost 60% of the metal was the most tedious and time consuming part, as it was required for every rack. Issues came along when certain spots weren’t cleaned well as porosity in the metal made it almost impossible to weld. I learned certain techniques which make the process faster through simultaneously having the welds look cleaner by going at a quicker speed, which also saves a lot of holes. With all things considered, it opened my eyes on how many structures and buildings we notice daily are made with welds 10x better than mine and Jonathan’s currently look now.
